# Project Creation

## Projects

Projects in QA Clan serve as the primary organizational unit for your test cases. They allow you to segregate and manage tests based on different websites, environments, or other criteria. Upon creating an account, you have the flexibility to create new projects and rename them as needed, tailoring your workspace to your specific testing requirements.
