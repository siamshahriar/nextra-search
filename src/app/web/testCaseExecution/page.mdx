# Test Case Execution

## Pass & Fail

During test execution, all assertions must pass for the test case to be marked as **successful**. If any assertion fails, the entire test case is automatically marked as **Failed**. This mechanism ensures that even a single discrepancy in the expected outcome is captured and highlighted.
