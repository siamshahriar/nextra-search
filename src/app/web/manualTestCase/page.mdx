## Steps to Create a Manual Test Case

1. **Log in to QA Clan**  
   Visit [https://app.qaclan.com/](https://app.qaclan.com/) and log in to your account.

2. **Access Your Project**  
   From the **Dashboard** or **Test Cases** section, select the project in which you want to create a manual test.

3. **Open Manual Test Case**  
   Click the **Manual Test Case** button, which opens a popup window prompting you to name your test case.

4. **Name Your Test Case**  
   Enter a descriptive name in the **Test Case Name** field, then click **Create Test Case**.

5. **Add Steps and Commands**  
   In the newly created manual test case, youâ€™ll see a series of rows where each row represents a step. Fill out the following fields for each step:

   - **Command**: Select an action from the dropdown (e.g., `goto`, `click`, `enter`, `select`, `wait`, `assert`, `search`, `press`).
   - **Target**: Specify the relevant element or URL (e.g., an `xpath` or a website address).
   - **Value**: Provide additional input if required by the command (e.g., text to enter).
   - **Note (optional)**: Add comments or instructions for clarity.

6. **Save and Run**  
   After adding the necessary steps, click **Save** to finalize your manual test case. You can then run it from the **Test Cases** menu, just like an automated test case.
