## Assertions

Assertions validate the correctness of outcomes by verifying that each step in a test case produces the expected result. They are a fundamental part of any test, as they confirm whether the application behaves as intended. Without assertions, tests would merely execute actions without validating outcomes, making it difficult to identify issues.

For example, consider a scenario where you need to ensure that a user successfully adds an item to their shopping cart. In this case, an assertion might verify that the cart's item count increases by one after the "Add to Cart" button is clicked, confirming that the functionality works as expected.

Additionally, the QA Clan recorder is designed to enforce the inclusion of assertions. If you attempt to complete a test recording without adding an assertion, the recorder will not submit the test case and will display a message: "No assertion step found." This ensures that every test case has the necessary verification steps to validate its outcomes.

### Types of Assertions

#### Text Assertion

To perform a **text assertion** during a recording:

1. Right-click while the recorder is active and select **QAClan Test Case Recorder** from the context menu.
2. Choose **Assert expected value** to open the **Expected Value** window.
3. From the first dropdown, select **Text Assertion**.
4. From the second dropdown, choose one of the following assertion types:
   - Equal
   - Contains
   - Starts With
   - Ends With
5. Enter the desired text in the **Give expected value here…** field.
6. Click **Submit**.

This process allows you to verify that specific text appears exactly as intended, providing confidence in the accuracy of your test results.

## Hover Action

To record a hover action:

1. Right-click while the recorder is active and select **QAClan Test Case Recorder** from the context menu.
